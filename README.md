# MoneFi-EmailServices

I worked on a project for MoneFi, a non-profit financial technology company that provides underserved and minority small business owners with borrowers, financial partners, and educational business opportunities. I used my knowledge of back-end development concepts to implement a dynamic email service using SendInBlue, C#, and ASP.NET. I also created an automated newsletter subscription database that allowed admins to create and manage newsletters using SQL, C#, and ASP.NET. Users could also sign up to MoneFi's newsletter subscription using React.js and Formik. I designed and developed SQL Server stored procedures, tables, UDTs, and constraints. I also implemented PropTypes, .Net DataAnnotations, and SQL constraints to layer data validation. During testing phases, I performed API calls using Postman to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API endpoints. I also have knowledge of front-end development principles and techniques such as sorting, filtering, routing, and mapping components for enhanced user experience.
