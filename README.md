# MoneFi-EmailServices

A project was undertaken for MoneFi, a non-profit financial technology organization focused on providing underserved and minority small business owners with borrowers, financial partners, and educational business opportunities. The project involved the implementation of a dynamic email service using SendInBlue, C#, and ASP.NET, leveraging back-end development concepts. Additionally, an automated newsletter subscription database was created using SQL, C#, and ASP.NET, enabling administrators to create and manage newsletters. The newsletter subscription feature was developed using React.js and Formik, allowing users to sign up for MoneFi's newsletters. The project also encompassed the design and development of SQL Server stored procedures, tables, UDTs, and constraints. Data validation was layered through the utilization of PropTypes, .Net DataAnnotations, and SQL constraints. Testing phases included performing API calls via Postman to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API endpoints. Front-end development principles and techniques such as sorting, filtering, routing, and mapping components were employed to enhance the user experience.
